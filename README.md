## 📖 Overview

**KITTI** is a privacy-first, AI-powered emotional companion designed to bridge the gap between high digital connectivity and emotional isolation. By gamifying mental wellness through a "digital pet" interface, KITTI transforms the chore of journaling into a comforting, daily habit.

Unlike generic chatbots, KITTI remembers your context, tracks your "Vibe," and offers proactive, safety-first support—all without sending your private journals to the cloud.
